# about this file
Based on the [UO library research guide on data management](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management) and UO's [Basic Accessibility Testing guidance](https://digitalaccessibility.uoregon.edu/assessment/basictesting).

# expected data and formats
*Data may originate from observations, experiments, or references; it may be derived from other sources, transformed, or the result of a simulation. Describe your data file formats. Whenever possible, [use non-proprietary formats](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management/fileformats) or convert your data to open, shareable formats when archiving data. Remember: data also includes your code and workflow documentation!*

- My images will be saved as JPEG, my work on Canva will be saved as a JPEG, any audio will be saved in .WAV. These file formats are the most shareable. 

# documentation and metadata
*Describe how you will [document your data](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management/readme) as you gather it. Descriptions of your data (or metadata) can help you and others locate, understand, and interpret your data. Describe the applicable standards for metadata content and format that you will follow, including the procedures and tools/software you will use to capture and edit the metadata.*

- I will keep my sources documented in Zotero, my findings in a google doc, and my data in Voyant/Palladio. I may have to save the data as a .csv or screenshot it and save it as a JPEG. I plan on presenting my findings in graphs, and inserting an audio description to help my viewers follow it. I will save all data files indivdually as a readme in plain text. I will ensure to accurately title each file to be cohesive with the rest and portray what is being saved. 

# organization and storage
*Describe your [file naming convention and version control practices](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management/filenaming). Describe [storage methods and backup procedures](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management/backup) for the data, including physical and cyber resources and facilities (hard-disk space, backup server, repository). Describe how you will take into consideration privacy, security, intellectual property, and other rights.*

For any images/JPEGS, I will save them as title_year_name_imagenumber(001, 002, 003...). The title will be labeled as Graph1, Graph2, etc. 
I will follow as similar format for audio files, but title them Audio1, Audio2, etc to correlate with their graph. I will store all of this on a personal flashdrive in a distinct folder. I will also save them to Google Drive so I can have multiple ways of accessing it. 


# sharing, publication, and archiving
*Describe what you will do to [provide others access to the data](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management/archiving). Identify any restrictions on who may access the data and under what conditions and a timeline for providing access. Also describe your plans for preserving data, outlining any changes in access anticipated during the preservation timeline, and documenting the resources and capabilities (e.g., equipment, connections, systems, expertise) needed to meet the preservation goals.*

- I will deposit my repository into Scholar Bank: Data through the University of Oregon. I will need to contact the UO Library to set this up. 

# accessibility
*Describe your plans for ensuring that your data and project outputs are accessible for users with disabilities. Basic accessibility features include the use of alternative text for images; captions and transcripts for videos; large, easy-to-read fonts; high-contrast color schemes; text content broken up logically with section headers and lists; and links embedded [in context](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/link-purpose-in-context.html) rather than on phrases like [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). Be specific about how you will implement accessibility features that are relevant to your data.*

- I will use clear fonts and bold colors in my graphs. Any photos used will be clear and easy to see. I will also include alt text and image captions, along with an audio description. The audio description will be normalized and set to -1db so it is clear to listeners. I will also make any writing visually pleasing by including headers, linked embedded in the text, and plenty of space between sections.
