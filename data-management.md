# expected data and formats

- My images are saved as JPEG. I also have pdf formats of my work, as well as the .csv file that supports it. 

# documentation and metadata

- I will keep my sources documented in Zotero, my findings in a google doc, and my data in Voyant/Palladio. I may have to save the data as a .csv. I plan on presenting my social media analysis in graphs. I will ensure to accurately title each file to be cohesive with the rest and portray what is being saved. 

# organization and storage

I will store all of my JPEGs, PDFs, .CSV, Etc. on a personal flashdrive in a distinct folder. I will also save them to Google Drive so I can have multiple ways of accessing it. 


# sharing, publication, and archiving

I will deposit my repository into Scholar Bank: Data through the University of Oregon. I will need to contact the UO Library to set this up. 

# accessibility

- I will use clear fonts and bold colors in my graphs. Any photos used will be clear and easy to see. I will also include alt text and image captions. To make make any writing visually pleasing, I will include headers, linked embedded in the text, and plenty of space between sections.
