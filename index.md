Welcome!

For my capstone project in ENG 470 at the University of Oregon, I conducted a research project regarding how digital marketing strategies have changed the Coachella Music Festival in the last five years. My project is composed of scholarly research, social media data analysis, and an interactive timeline which display the information I have gathered. My goal for this project is to preserve data for future reference as the music festival advances and digital marketing strategies develop. To learn more about my research process, the work I created, and my data management please view the links below.

## What is Coachella?
Coachella is an annual 3-day music festival that takes place over two weekends in April in Indio, California. It began in 1999 and has been held every year since, excluding 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic. Five years ago in 2019, attendance peaked at 99,000 people. This year, 2023, the attendance rate significantly increased to 125,000 people. The Grammy Awards states, "The 2023 edition of Coachella — which sold out its first weekend, ushering in roughly 125,000 people from around the globe — was arguably the most consequential in its 22 years". 

## What Draws People to Live Music Festivals?
When conducting my research to discover what is most desirable about live music festivals, I collected a variety of significant key terms which are displayed below.

People tend to desire several emotional and physical experiences from live music; It provides unique experiences and feelings of enjoyment. These include:
- The sensation of hearing and feeling loud music.
- Seeing unique performances.
- Witnessing the power of crowds and experiencing a shared human connection.
- Having a euphoric state of mind.

Gina Arnold states in her book, *Half a Million Strong: Crowds and Power from Woodstock to Coachella* that, “On the surface, raves seem to be advertisements not for people, not for music, but for a state of mind” (Arnold 125). 

Fabian Holt states, in his book *Everyone Loves Live Music: A Theory of Performance Institutions*, “In the interpersonal experience on the dance floor, the repetition of the beat not only sustains movement, but it also creates a field of action for dancers, coordinating movements and engendering collective feeling” (Holt 48) Holts book expands on how music festivals, pop culture, public culture influence eachother and how it has changed over time. He talks about the power live music holds and how corporations have consumed it and used it for their own benefit. Holts chapter, "Festival Video and Social Media" elaborates on the capabilities of recorded and live video footage of a music festival. Corporations can use this kind of technology to capture this euphoria and people making unique, memorable memories. It is used to share with the world and target people who are not there in hopes ofearning their approval to purchase a ticket for next year. 
I downloaded this chapter into Voyant, to visually show the connections between the use of the words, "video", "live", "experience", "culture", "crowd", and "social media".
