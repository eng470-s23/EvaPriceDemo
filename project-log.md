## pitch
- My research topic is: The effects digital culture has on music festival cultureâ€” specifically Coachella.
- My research question is: How does digital culture influence the popularity of Coachella?
- I expect to work with the following *materials*: I plan to use the following texts from the UO library: Coachella Fans, Online and Translocal by Diane L., In the Shadow of Los Angeles: A Review of Local and Regional Press Coverage of the Inland Empire's Contemporary Music Scenes, B.C. (Before Coachella) By Waleed Rashidi, and Voices from beyond the grave: Virtual Tupac's live performance at Coachella By Katherine Fusco.
- I plan to *process* these materials by: Reading through each text and finding the most valuable information relating to my topic. I will keep track of the text, author, quotes and other information in an organized google document. 
- I plan to *present* these materials by: Creating a video essay explainging my findings that also incorporates images that is accessible on github and my pre-exisiting WordPress domain that includes previous work I have on music studies. I will also incorporate a page dedicated to past line ups, sourced from Coachella's website and attendance rates that are formatted in an infographic. 
- My final submission will take this form: Github and WordPress. 
- This project is intended to engage these audiences and communities: Digital Sociologists and Public Relations professionals in the music industry.
- I bring the following existing knowledge and/or skills to the project: My pre-exisiting background on studying music history and sound design, public relations, WordPress, and sourcing credible information.
- In order to do this project, I need to learn: Certain WordPress plugins, Visme, and how to make a quality video essay.
