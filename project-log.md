## pitch
- My research topic is: The effects digital culture has on music festival culture— specifically Coachella.
- My research question is: How does digital culture influence the popularity of Coachella?
- I expect to work with the following *materials*: I plan to use the following texts from the UO library: Coachella Fans, Online and Translocal by Diane L., In the Shadow of Los Angeles: A Review of Local and Regional Press Coverage of the Inland Empire's Contemporary Music Scenes, B.C. (Before Coachella) By Waleed Rashidi, and Voices from beyond the grave: Virtual Tupac's live performance at Coachella By Katherine Fusco.
- I plan to *process* these materials by: Reading through each text and finding the most valuable information relating to my topic. I will keep track of the text, author, quotes and other information in an organized google document. 
- I plan to *present* these materials by: Creating a video essay explainging my findings that also incorporates images that is accessible on github and my pre-exisiting WordPress domain that includes previous work I have on music studies. I will also incorporate a page dedicated to past line ups, sourced from Coachella's website and attendance rates that are formatted in an infographic. 
- My final submission will take this form: Github and WordPress. 
- This project is intended to engage these audiences and communities: Digital Sociologists and Public Relations professionals in the music industry.
- I bring the following existing knowledge and/or skills to the project: My pre-exisiting background on studying music history and sound design, public relations, WordPress, and sourcing credible information.
- In order to do this project, I need to learn: Certain WordPress plugins, Visme, and how to make a quality video essay.

## bibliography
*The bibliography should include at least seven (7) sources:*
- *at least one primary (literary or archival) source or dataset you are studying or examining;* 
- *at least four peer-reviewed scholarly sources framing and informing your thinking: articles, chapters, or books published by university or academic presses, or excerpts from academic reference sources (note that being deposited in Scholars' Bank does *not* mean a source is peer reviewed.)*
- *the other 2+ sources may be primary, scholarly, popular, journalistic, governmental/policy documents, datasets, etc.*

1. source #1: Arnold, G. (2018). Half a Million Strong: Crowds and Power from Woodstock to Coachella. University of Iwoa Press. https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=bWV0DwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR5&dq=Woodstock+And+Beyond:+How+the+Modern+Music+Festival+Came+To+Be&ots=xADKmB7FNJ&sig=ybSGbmLLFQidrQnhIvtbJ898DDc#v=onepage&q&f=false. This piece provides insight about the "prefestival" era and the current festival culture. It seperates music genre and performer expectations from Woodstock to the modern day popular festivals. This will be beneficial to the growth of my project due to the large amount of information regarding music festival culture and how historically, large festivals have been promoted differently in the media. Thus, resulting in a different societal mindset surrinding music festival culture and expectations. 
3. source #2: Bennet, A. (2022). The Bloomsbury Handbook of Popular Music and Youth Culture. Bloomsbury Publishing USA. https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=6ZuiEAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT15&dq=The+Bloomsbury+Handbook+of+Popular+Music+and+Youth+Culture&ots=MsRBdhHIfY&sig=ycWy4a6nmkdqW6J0Bs_NsY9hjfg#v=onepage&q=The%20Bloomsbury%20Handbook%20of%20Popular%20Music%20and%20Youth%20Culture&f=false. This piece includes a caiety of information relating to my project. First, it touches on the structure and history of youth music taste. It also talks about music scenes and aging, popular brand culture, and youth identity thats emmersed in digital technologies. There is a lot of information within this book, and I believe it will help me build solid points, share factual information and spark new connections within my research.
4. source #3: Cranny, C. (2020). Dancing in the Desert: A Case Study on the Digital Marketing Techniques of Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival by. https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1010&context=expindsp. This piece will be beneficial to my project because it includes 33 pages of information regarding digital marketing and Coachella music festival culture. Cranny includes information from a marketing and a consumer perspective. She also includes her case study that examines the digital marketing practices of Coachella. Her findings determine what makes Coachella successful. 
5. source #4: Fusco, K. (2015). Voices from beyond the grave: Virtual Tupac’s live performance at Coachella By. Duke University Press. https://read.dukeupress.edu/camera-obscura/article/30/2%20(89)/29/58545/Voices-from-Beyond-the-Grave-Virtual-Tupac-s-Live. This piece focuses on the relationship between performance and performer— specifically TuPac. I believe this text will help me tie my points regarding the lack of authenticity in Coachella. The media creates images for performers, and which this piece explains. Overall, the relationship between media, performer, and in-person and social interactios.
6. source #5: Gillin, P. (2008). New Media, New Influencers and Implications for the Public Relations Profession. Journal of New Communications Research. https://www.issuelab.org/resources/928/928.pdf. This piece will help me develop my project through a public relations lense. It includes information about influencers, digital marketing, and the many developing channels used in communications. The most important component of this piece is the numerous infographics and visual data it provides surronding the topic. I believe this visual data will help me learn more about my topic as well as spark inspiration for the type of visual data I want to create for my project. 
7. source #6: Hudson, S. (n.d.). The effects of social media on emotions, brand relationship quality, and word of mouth: An empirical study of music festival attendees. ScienceDirect. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S026151771400171X?via%3Dihub. This piece focuses on the management of music festivals and the influence on social media on customer relationships. It primarly focuses on these under-researched relationships. The information provided in this text will help me provide evidence that supports my claim. The connection this text draws between human emotion, tourism, event management and public relations will be useful in my project.
9. source #7: Rashidi, W. (2020). In the Shadow of Los Angeles: A Review of Local and Regional Press Coverage of the Inland Empire’s Contemporary Music Scenes. Taylor and Francis. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/figure/10.1080/03007766.2020.1730648?scroll=top&needAccess=true&role=tab&aria-labelledby=figs-data. This final piece will help support my claim as well as lead to a more solid answer to my research question. It mainly focuses on press coverage on contemporary music scenes prior to Coachella. I think this information will mainly support my explanation of how much the media has influenced Coachella over the last 20 years. It takes geographic location into consideration when making it's argument which I also think is interesting and an important factor.
