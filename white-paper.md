# What's a White Paper?

In digital humanities, it is common for project teams to publish a report of funded development activities after a grant cycle is completed. The following template is taken from the [instructions provided by the National Endowment for the Humanities](https://www.neh.gov/how-write-successful-white-paper-tips-odh) to recipients of Digital Humanities Advancement Grants.

## Project Origins and Goals
I have created a digital humanities project curated through scholarly research on the influences of digital marketing on the experience provided by the Coachella music festival. My project will contribute answers to how Coachella's digital marketing provides a specific emotional experience at the festival; It highlights the successful marketing tactics and strategies that illuminate the experience for individuals, including the typical consumer and influencer who attend the event. 

I referred to peer-reviewed scholarly research provided by google scholar and the UO library. Additionally, I gathered information from TikTok to discover data sets to compute in tools like Excel, Voyant, and Palladio. These tools will guide me in gathering appropriate information to support my research question as well as discover data and re-occurring patterns.

This project provides a scholarly approach to how Coachella's digital marketing strategies are effective on the average consumer and influence the experience as a whole. Therefore, it mainly targets public relations professionals in the music industry, academic scholars, and potential stakeholders. This project will also target consumers intrigued by the topic as a sub-audience. 

I hope this information is useful to both those experiencing the festival and those behind the online marketing process. The data and knowledge found within my project are intended for current and future reference as the Coachella Music Festival continues to advance. I believe there is a lot to learn about the connection between digital marketing in the media and live performances at popular music festivals, so there is plenty of information yet to be contributed.
